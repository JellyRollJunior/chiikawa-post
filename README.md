### Retrospective (aka yapping)

I finished my backend before working on front end. This approach makes me feel a bit sad because I'm looking at an ugly app for 65% of the dev process. I will do a bit of styling + backend in the future. I'm getting used to coding express apps though! The db queries were much simpler on this project.
